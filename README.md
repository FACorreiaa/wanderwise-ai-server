# **Loci** – Personalized City Discovery 🗺️✨

Loci is a smart, mobile-first web application delivering hyper-personalized city exploration recommendations based on user interests, time, location, and an evolving AI engine. It starts with an HTTP/REST API, utilizing WebSockets/SSE for real-time features.

Tired of generic city guides? loci learns your preferences (history, food, art, etc.) and combines them with your available time and location to suggest the perfect spots.

- **🧠 AI-Powered Personalization:** Recommendations adapt to explicit preferences and learned behavior.
- **🔍 Contextual Filtering:** Filter by distance, time, opening hours, interests, and soon, budget.
- **🗺 Interactive Map Integration:** Visualize recommendations and routes.
- **📌 Save & Organize:** Bookmark favorites and create lists/itineraries (enhanced in Premium).
- **📱 Mobile-First Design:** Optimized for on-the-go web browsing.

## 💰 Business Model & Monetization

Loci uses a **Freemium Model**:

- **Free Tier:** Core recommendations, basic filters, limited saves, non-intrusive ads.
- **Premium Tier (Subscription):** Enhanced/Advanced AI recommendations & filters (niche tags, cuisine, accessibility), unlimited saves, offline access, exclusive content, ad-free.

**Monetization Avenues:**

- Premium Subscriptions
- **Partnerships & Commissions:** Booking referrals (GetYourGuide, Booking.com, OpenTable), transparent featured listings, exclusive deals.
- **Future:** One-time purchases (guides), aggregated anonymized trend data.

## 🛠 Technology Stack & Design Choices

The stack prioritizes performance, personalization, SEO, and developer experience.

- **Backend:** **Go (Golang)** with **Chi/Gin Gonic**, **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** (for geospatial queries), `pgx` or `sqlc`.
  - _Rationale:_ Go for performance and concurrency; PostGIS for essential location features.
- **Frontend:** **SvelteKit** _or_ **Next.js (React)** with **Tailwind CSS**, **Mapbox GL JS/MapLibre GL JS/Leaflet**.
  - _Rationale:_ Modern SSR frameworks for SEO and performance.
- **AI / Recommendation Engine:**

Direct Google Gemini API integration via `google/generative-ai-go` SDK.** \* _Rationale:_ Leverage latest models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) for deep personalization via rich prompts and function calling to access PostgreSQL data (e.g., nearby POIs from PostGIS). \* **Vector Embeddings:\*\* PostgreSQL with `pgvector` extension for semantic search and advanced recommendations.

- **API Layer:** Primary **HTTP/REST API**.
  - _Rationale:_ Simplicity for frontend integration and broad compatibility. gRPC considered for future backend-to-backend needs.
- **Authentication:** Standard JWT + `Goth` package for social logins.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose; Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure for managed services like Postgres, Kubernetes/Fargate/Cloud Run); CI/CD (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI).

## 🗺️ Roadmap Highlights

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Core recommendation engine (Gemini-powered), user accounts, map view, itinerary personalisation.
- **Phase 2:** Premium tier, enhanced AI (embeddings, `pgvector`), add more gemini features like

* speech to text
* itinerary download to different formats (pdf/markdown)
* itinerary uploads
* 24/7 agent more personalised agent

reviews/ratings, booking partnerships.

- **Phase 3:** Multi-city expansion, curated content, native app exploration.
